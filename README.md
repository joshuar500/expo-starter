## Tech Decisions

This starter project is a barebones Javascript project with some additional libraries to help jump start the development process.

[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) is the standard router library for React Native to switch between screens.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) standardizes code formatting in order to keep code clean with little effort.

The file structure I've created are for `screens` and `components` -- I recommend creating `services`, `middleware`, `utils` and anything else if the project becomes complex.
