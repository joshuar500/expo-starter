## Comments

This starter project is a barebones Javascript project with some additional libraries to help jump start the development process. It includes some tabbed and stack views using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). I've also added [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in order to keep code clean with little effort. The file structure I've created are for `screens` and `components` -- I recommend creating `services`, `navigation`, `middleware`, `utils` and anything else if the project becomes complex.
